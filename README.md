# FlashCardsApp

_FlashCardsApp is the 3rd and final project to complete Udacity's React Nanodegree program._

FlashCardsApp allows users to create flash cards to aid in studying regardless of the topic they are trying to grasp. The app allows users to create a deck which represents the general topic, and add cards that contain a question and answer for that deck.

_for example_: 

In the deck titled 'Biology' a user might have a question:

_'What group of animals do humans classify as?'_

Answer: _'Mammals'_

**_The user can also flip between the question and answer to see if they got the question correct._**
